# 🗂️ Curated Earth Science Explorer – Atlas Template App Preview

This project highlights the use of the **ArcGIS Instant Apps – Atlas template** to curate and present earthquake and volcano research for classroom learning. This is the third exercise completed as part of the **ESRI MOOC: "Building GeoApps"**.

> 🎯 **Objective**: Provide a flexible and focused web environment where students can explore, annotate, and share curated geospatial information related to tectonic activity.

## 🧩 Steps Followed

1. **Explored an example app** made with the Atlas template:
   - Interacted with tools like *Add Layer*, *Map Layers*, and *Language Switcher*
   - Tested visibility and layout for curated data

2. **Previewed the template using own map**:
   - Opened a saved *Global Earthquakes* map from previous exercises
   - Verified compatibility with the template

3. **Used tools like**:
   - **Sketch tool** to mark zones of interest
   - **Screenshot exporter** to generate PDF map outputs
   - **Layer controls** for adjusting transparency, visibility, and tabular views

4. **Evaluated the template’s usefulness** for allowing students to explore, personalize, and communicate geographic findings.

## 📖 Learning Outcome

This project illustrates how to:

- Assess template fit for specific educational needs
- Enable students to **interact and annotate geospatial data**
- Preview and test apps using real datasets before deployment
- Use Atlas’s unique **modification + curation** tools
