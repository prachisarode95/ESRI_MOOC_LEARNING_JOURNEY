# 🌍 Earthquake Research App – ArcGIS Instant App Exercise

This is a part of the **ESRI MOOC: "Building GeoApps"** and showcases the creation of an interactive **ArcGIS Instant App** using **ArcGIS Online services**. Designed for a classroom setting, the app helps students explore tectonic plates, fault lines, and earthquake activity in a user-friendly web interface.

> 🎯 **Objective**: Create a multipurpose web app that visualizes real-time earthquake data alongside tectonic plates and fault lines for Earth Science learning.
