# 🌍 ESRI MOOC Learning Journey – ArcGIS Online & Web App Projects

Welcome to my ESRI MOOC Learning Journey repository! This collection showcases the practical, hands-on exercises I completed through **Esri's "Make an Impact with Modern Geo Apps** and other ArcGIS web-focused trainings.

Though the hosted apps have expired post-course, this repository documents my **workflow design, tool configuration, and dashboard logic** through detailed `.md` files for each mini-project.
