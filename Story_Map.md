# 🌍 ESRI MOOC Story Map Exercise

This project showcases my hands-on experience with creating a **Story Map** using Esri's ArcGIS Online platform. It is based on the **"Do-It-Yourself Geo Apps"** MOOC provided by Esri. Through this exercise, I explored the capabilities of ArcGIS StoryMaps to communicate geographic information effectively using multimedia, maps, and narrative structure.

## 📘 About the Exercise

The project is based on a guided exercise from the Esri MOOC, where I developed a **Map Tour Story Map** using an ArcGIS Online account. The task involved:

- Selecting a theme: *"Places I’ve Traveled To"*.
- Uploading geotagged images and providing narrative descriptions for each location.
- Customizing the story layout, appearance, and map interactions.

This exercise helped me understand the power of web-based GIS storytelling.
