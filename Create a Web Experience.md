## 📌 Project Objective

To create an interactive **web experience** using ArcGIS Online that integrates:
- A **web map** with custom symbology and pop-ups,
- A **web app** to display spatial data in a user-friendly interface,
- A **web experience** that combines maps, multimedia, and text for spatial storytelling.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- ArcGIS Online
- Map Viewer
- Instant Apps (ArcGIS Online)
- Experience Builder (ArcGIS Online)
- Web Mapping Tools (ArcGIS Online)

## 🗺 Project Summary

The exercise simulates a typical GIS workflow for **public-facing mapping projects**. I performed the following:

1. **Explored spatial data** using ArcGIS Online feature layers
2. **Created a web map** with meaningful symbols and informative pop-ups
3. **Built an instant web app** to showcase the map in an accessible format
4. **Designed a web experience** combining the app, text, and images
5. **Shared the experience** with the public via a secure URL
